# Demo applications and utilities

The C++ application `sysregs` is a generic tool to read and write the system registers.
With option `-v` (verbose), most system registers are structured using bit-fields of various
sizes and interpretation. Using option `-a` (all), they are all individually displayed.
Use option `--help` for more details.

The C++ application `demo-pac` demonstrates some usages of the pointer authentication features.
